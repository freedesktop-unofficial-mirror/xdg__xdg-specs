    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Both the KDE and GNOME desktop environments have adopted a similar
      format for "desktop entries", or configuration files describing how a
      particular program is to be launched, how it appears in menus, etc.
      It is to the larger community's benefit that a unified standard be
      agreed upon by all parties such that interoperation between the two
      environments, and indeed any additional environments that implement
      the specification, becomes simpler.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="basic-format">
    <title>Basic format of the file</title>
    <para>
      These desktop entry files should have the extension
      <filename>.desktop</filename>. Determining file type on basis of
      extension makes determining the file type very easy and quick.
      When no file extension is present, the desktop system should
      fall back to recognition via "magic detection".  Desktop entries
      which describe how a directory is to be formatted/displayed
      should be simply called <filename>.directory</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The basic format of the desktop entry file requires that there be a
      "group" header named <literal>[Desktop Entry]</literal>.
      This "group" entry denotes that all
      <literal>{key,value}</literal> pairs following it    belong in
      the Desktop Entry group.  There may be other groups present in
      the file (see MIME types discussion below), but this is the most
      important group which explicitly needs to be supported.  This group
      should also be used as the "magic key" for automatic MIME type
      detection.  There should be nothing proceeding this group in the
      desktop entry file but possibly one or more comments (see
      below).
    </para>
    <para>
      Group headers may not contain the characters <literal>[</literal> and
      <literal>]</literal> as those delimit the header.
    </para>
    <para>
      Lines beginning with a <literal>#</literal> and blank lines are
      considered comments and will be ignored, however they should be
      preserved across reads and writes of the desktop entry file.
    </para>
    <para>
      Compliant implementations MUST not remove any fields from the file,
      even if they don't support them.  Such fields must be maintained in a
      list somewhere, and if the file is "rewritten", they will be included.
      This ensures that any desktop-specific extensions will be preserved
      even if another system accesses and changes the file.
    </para>
    <para>
      Entries in the file are <literal>{key,value}</literal> pairs in the format:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
Name=Value</programlisting>
    <para>
      Space before and after the equals sign should be ignored; the <literal>=</literal>
      sign is the actual delimiter.
    </para>
    <para>
      The escape sequences <literal>\s</literal>,
      <literal>\n</literal>, <literal>\t</literal>,
      <literal>\r</literal>, and <literal>\\</literal> are supported,
      meaning ASCII space, newline, tab, carriage return, and
      backslash, respectively.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="value-types">
    <title>Possible value types</title>
    <para>
      The value types recognized are string, localestring, regexp,
      boolean (encoded as the string true/false), and numeric.
    </para>
    <para>
      The difference between string and localestring is that the value for
      a string key must contain only ASCII characters while the value
      of a localestring key may contain UTF-8 characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some keys can have multiple values; these should be separated by a
      semicolon.  Those keys which have several values should have a
      semicolon as the trailing character. For lists of strings, 
      semicolons are simply not allowed in the strings, there is no 
      escape mechanism.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="recognized-keys">B
    <title>Recognized desktop entry keys</title>
    <para>
	  Keys  with type localestring may be postfixed by [<replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable>],
	  where <replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable> is the locale type of the
	  entry.  <replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable> must be of the form
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>,
	  where
	  <literal>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable></literal>,
	  <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal>, 
	  and <literal>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>
	  may be omitted. If a postfixed key occurs, the same
	  key must be also present without the postfix.
    </para>
    <para>
      When reading in the desktop entry file, the value of the key is
      selected by matching the current POSIX locale for the
      <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> category against the
      <replaceable>LOCALE</replaceable> postfixes of all occurrences
      of the key, with the
      <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part
      stripped. The
      <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> field is
      used only when the value of the <varname>Encoding</varname> key
      for the desktop entry file is <constant>Legacy-Mixed</constant>
      (see <xref linkend="legacy-mixed"/>.)
    </para>
    <para>
	  The matching of is done as follows.  If
	  <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> is of the form
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>, 
	  then it will match a key of the form
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>. 
	  If such a key does not exist, it will attempt to match
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable></literal>
	  followed by
	  <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>@<replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable></literal>.
	  Then, a match against <replaceable>lang</replaceable> by itself
	  will be attempted.  Finally, if no matching key is found the
	  required key without a locale specified is used.  The encoding
	  from the <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> value is ignored
	  when matching.
    </para>
    <para>
      If <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> does not have a <replaceable>MODIFIER</replaceable>
      field, then no key with a modifier will be matched.  Similarly, if
      <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> does not have a <replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable>
      field, then no key with a country specified will be matched.  If
      <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> just has a <replaceable>lang</replaceable> field, then
      it will do a straight match to a key with a similar value.  The
      following table lists possible matches of various <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> values in
      the order in which they are matched.  Note that the
      <replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable> field isn't shown.

      For example, if the current value of the <varname>LC_MESSAGES</varname> category
      is <literal>sr_YU@Latn</literal> and the desktop file includes:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
 Name=Foo
 Name[sr_YU]=...
 Name[sr@Latn]=...
 Name[sr]=...</programlisting>
    <para>
      then the value of the <varname>Name</varname> keyed by <literal>sr_YU</literal> is used.
    </para>
    <para>
      Case is significant.  The keys <varname>Name</varname> and <varname>NAME</varname> are not equivalent.
      The same holds for group names.  Key values are case sensitive as
      well.
    </para>
    <para>
      Keys are either OPTIONAL or REQUIRED.  If a key is optional it may or
      may not be present in the file.  However, if it isn't, the
      implementation of the standard should not blow up, it must provide
      some sane defaults.  Additionally, keys either MUST or MAY be
      supported by a particular implementation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some keys only make sense in the context when another particular key
      is also present.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some example keys: <varname>Name[C]</varname>, <varname>Comment[it]</varname>.

		  This can be useful to e.g. associate this application with MIME types, so that
		  it gets launched from a file manager (or other apps), without having a menu
		  entry for it (there are tons of good reasons for this, including e.g. the
		  <literal>netscape -remote</literal>, or <literal>kfmclient openURL</literal> kind of stuff).

		  <varname>Hidden</varname> should have been called <varname>Deleted</varname>.
		  It means the user deleted (at his level)
		  something that was present (at an upper level, e.g. in the system dirs). It's
		  strictly equivalent to the <filename>.desktop</filename> file not existing at all, as far as that user is
		  concerned. This can also be used to "uninstall" existing files (e.g. due to a renaming)
		  - by letting <literal>make install</literal> install a file with <literal>Hidden=true</literal> in it.

    <title>Detailed discussion of supporting MIME types</title>
    <para>
      It is in every desktop's best interest to have thorough support for
      MIME types.  The old <filename>/etc/mailcap</filename> and
      <filename>/etc/mime.types</filename> files are rather
      limited in scope and frankly, are outdated.  Various desktop systems
      have come up with different ways of extending this original system,
      but none are compatible with each other.  The Desktop Entry Specification
      hopes to be able to provide the beginnings of a solution to this
      problem.
    </para>
    <para>
      At a very basic level, the <varname>Exec</varname> key provides the default action to
      take when the program described by a desktop entry is used to open a
      document or data file.  Usually this consists of some action along the
      lines of <literal>kedit %f</literal> or <literal>ee %f</literal>.  This is a good
      start, but it isn't as flexible as it can be.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let us first establish that a program which supports a MIME type or
      multiple MIME types may be able to support multiple actions on those
      MIME types as well.  The desktop entry may want to define additional
      actions in addition to the default.  The top level <varname>Exec</varname> key describes
      the default action; Let us define this action to also be known as the
      "Open" action.  Additional actions which might be possible include
      "View", "Edit", "Play", etc.  A further revision of this document will
      probably specify several "standard" actions in addition to the default
      "Open" action, but in all cases, the number of actions is
      arbitrary.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let us use a sound player as a simple example.  Call it <literal>sp</literal>.  The
      default <varname>Exec</varname> (Open) action for this program would likely look
      something like:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
Exec=sp %u</programlisting>
    <para>
      However, imagine the sound player also supports editing of sound files
      in a graphical manner.  We might wish to define an additional action
      which could accommodate this.  Adding the action would be performed
      like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
Actions=Edit;

[Desktop Action Edit]
Exec=sp -edit %u</programlisting>
    <para>
      As you can see, defining the action "Edit" will enable an additional
      group of the name <literal>[Desktop Action <replaceable>actionname</replaceable>]</literal> to be read.  This
      group can contain an additional <varname>Exec</varname> line, as well as possibly other
      information like a new <varname>Name</varname>,
      <varname>Comment</varname>, <varname>Icon</varname>, and
      <varname>Path</varname>.  Thus
      right-clicking on a .wav file will show both the default "Open" action
      and this "Edit" action to both be displayed as choices in the
      context-menu.  A left click (double or single, whichever the file
      manager implements) would cause the default action to take place.
      These are implementation specific details which are up to the
      implementer, and are not enforced by this standard.
    </para>
    <para>
      If no <varname>DefaultApp</varname> is specified for a particular MIME type, any one of
      the programs registered which claim to be able to handle the MIME type
      may become the default handler.  This behaviour is undefined and
      implementation specific. KDE doesn't use a <varname>DefaultApp</varname> anymore, but assigns
      a preference number to each program, so that the highest number is the
      one chosen for handling the MIME type.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="extending">
    <title>Extending the format</title>
    <para>
      If the standard is to be amended with a new <literal>{key,value}</literal> pair which
      should be applicable to all supporting parties, a group discussion
      will take place.  This is the preferred method for introducing
      changes.  If one particular party wishes to add a field for personal
      use, they should prefix the key with the string <varname>X-<replaceable>PRODUCT</replaceable></varname>,
      e.g. <varname>X-NewDesktop-Foo</varname>, following the precedent set by other IETF and RFC
      standards.
    </para>
    <para>
      Alternatively, fields can be placed in their own group, where they may
      then have arbitrary key names.  If this is the case, the group should
      follow the scheme outlined above,
      i.e. <literal>[X-<replaceable>PRODUCT</replaceable>
      <replaceable>GROUPNAME</replaceable>]</literal> or
      something similar.  These steps will avoid namespace clashes between
      different yet similar environments.

  <appendix id="legacy-mixed">
    <title>The <constant>Legacy-Mixed</constant> Encoding (Deprecated)</title>
    <para>
      The <constant>Legacy-Mixed</constant> encoding corresponds to the traditional encoding
      of desktop files in older versions of the GNOME and KDE desktop
      files. In this encoding, the encoding of each localestring key
      is determined by the locale tag for that key, if any. For keys
      without a locale tag, the value must contain only ASCII 
      characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the file specifies an unsupported encoding, the implementation
      should either ignore the file, or, if the user has requested a direct
      operation on the file (such as opening it for editing), display an
      appropriate error indication to the user.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the absence of an <varname>Encoding</varname> line, the implementation may choose
      to autodetect the encoding of the file by using such factors
      as:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The location of the file on the file system
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Whether the contents of the file are valid UTF-8
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      If the implementation does not perform such auto-detection, it should
      treat a file without an <varname>Encoding</varname> key in the same way as a file with an
      unsupported <varname>Encoding</varname> Key.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the locale tag includes an <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part, then that determines
      the encoding for the line. Otherwise, the encoding is determined
      by the language, or
      <literal><replaceable>lang</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY</replaceable></literal>
      pair from the locale tag, according to the following table.

	    The name given here is listed here is typically the
	    canonical name for the encoding in the GNU C Library's
	    <function>iconv</function> facility.  Encodings marked with (*) are not
	    currently supported by the GNU C Library; for this reason,
	    implementations may choose to ignore lines in desktop
	    files that resolve to this encoding. Desktop files with
	    these encodings are currently rare or non-existent.

      This table above covers all tags and encodings that are known to
      be currently in use. Implementors may choose to support
      encodings not in the above set. For tags without defaults listed
      in the above table, desktop file creators must specify the
      <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part of the locale tag.
    </para>
    <para>
      Matching the <literal>.<replaceable>ENCODING</replaceable></literal> part of the locale tag against a locale
      name or alias should be done by stripping all punctuation
      characters from both the tag and the name or alias, converting
      both name and alias to lowercase, and comparing the result.
      This is necessary because, for example, <literal>Big5</literal> is frequently
      found instead of <literal>BIG5</literal> and <literal>georgianacademy</literal> instead of
      <literal>GEORGIAN-ACADEMY</literal>. Desktop files creators should, however, use
      the name as it appears in the "Encoding" column above.
