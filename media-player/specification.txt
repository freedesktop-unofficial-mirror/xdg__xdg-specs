Abstract

This specification describes various audio file tag metadata 
intended to increase interoperability between free music players 
for things such as ratings, playcounts, performer roles, and 
more. It does this by proposing standards for common 
functionality needs where none currently exist, and doing so in a 
way that is easily adoptable cross-player and cross-format. It is 
designed to be robust against future needs and to prevent 
possible conflicts with other tag identifiers and values.

1 Metadata Tags

The metadata tag formats evolved from Quod Libet's VorbisComments 
suggestions at http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Specs_VorbisComments
, however this attempts to not only address ambiguities and 
incompatibilities with the specification at that URL, but also to 
define how this functionality should be applied cross-format. It 
is intended that as usable ways of inserting the metadata 
described become available for formats not currently specified, 
that this document will be updated to meet those needs.

All newly-specified tags carry an identifier “FMPS_” to tie the 
tags to this specification. The reason is simple. Since the 
official metadata specifications either fail to define or define 
unusable tags, these value are only official to the extent that 
this specification is adopted. Without an identifier to give 
context to the meanings and limitations of the values, there is a 
real possibility that a noncompliant media player will use the 
same tag names in an incompatible fashion, whether intentionally 
or not, and there is no way to determine whether a seemingly 
compatible use of the tags by a noncompliant player actually 
results in user-intended behavior. The “FMPS_” identifier and 
this specification document is therefore used in a similar 
fashion to XML schema declarations.

As these identifiers are read and modified only by players and 
advanced users, it is not expected to be a hindrance to adoption 
or to cause undue burden on either.

1.1 Common Data and Tag Information

This section provides “up-front” information that is pertinent to 
all tags described below, such as what encoding to use and which 
tags to use in various formats.

For all tag formats, the following is defined:

• All identifers and values are strings in UTF-8 encoding. To 
  keep the specification simple, no ranges of control characters 
  are defined which should never be included in a string. It is 
  assumed that the used string-handling library will properly 
  handle any such characters encountered.

• A period/full stop is used to separate the digits in a float 
  value from the fractional part of the float. All float values 
  must include a period/full stop (1 is not acceptable; 1.0 is 
  correct).

• Float values should be limited to six decimal places.

• Any spaces in identifiers should be represented using 
  underscores ( _ ) instead, although this can be converted to 
  spaces for display to the user.

• Although identifier case is specified for the different types 
  of tags, it is probably a good idea to do comparisons against 
  identifier strings converted to all upper- or lower-case in 
  case some implementations do not properly adhere to the case 
  specified. Note that where identifiers also store other 
  information (for instance FMPS_RATING_CRITIC_Metacritic), 
  proper capitalization for the variable part of the identifier 
  should be used, as this should be displayed as-is to the user.

• Variable parts of identifiers should use equal signs (“=”) to 
  denote spaces when the variable is a person's name, and 
  underscores (“_”) to denote spaces when the variable is the 
  name of a publication or site.

The following sections describe where the information should be 
stored in specific tag formats.

1.1.1 MP3

MP3 values should be stored in a TXXX frame with the Description 
set to the specified identifier and the Text set to the string 
representation of the value. The Description should be in 
CamelCase as specified in the following sections, e.g. 
FMPS_Rating.

1.1.2 VorbisComments

Any file supporting VorbisComments (Vorbis, FLAC, Theora, Speex) 
should add a comment with the Key set to the specified identifier 
and the Value set to the string representation of the value. The 
Key should be in all upper-case, e.g. FMPS_RATING.

1.1.3 APEv2

Any file supporting APEv2 should add a comment with the Key set 
to the specified identifier and the Value set to the string 
representation of the value. The Key should be in all upper-case, 
e.g. FMPS_RATING.

1.1.4 MP4

MP4 values should be stored at ----:com.apple.iTunes:Identifier 
with the value a string representation of the tag's value. The 
Identifier should be in CamelCase as specified in the following 
sections, e.g. FMPS_Rating.

1.1.5 Windows Media

Windows Media values should be stored in the FMPS/Identifier 
namespace with the value a string representation of the tag's 
value. The Identifier should be in CamelCase as specified in the 
following sections, e.g. FMPS_Rating.

1.2 Song Rating Tags

Most media players support the notion of rating content, however 
standards for storing ratings in files do not exist. Some file 
metadata formats completely lack rating fields; others require 
personal information to be used as an identifier (such as a 
user's email address) or an organizational identifier (which 
reduces cross-player compatibility). The goal therefore is 
simple: to avoid any personal identifying information but avoid 
tying the rating to a specific player.

Three types of ratings are currently defined: user ratings, 
critic ratings, and automatic (or algorithmic) ratings.

Although users are more naturally able to understand integer 
ratings, only advanced users will interact with these tags 
directly; otherwise they will be presented to the user via a 
conforming application. Meanwhile, there are tangible benefits to 
storing ratings as floating-point numbers, mainly due to the fact 
that the increased precision allows for a number of interesting 
and useful algorithmic rating schemes to be used. However, using 
both integer and floating-point values unnecessarily increases 
complexity of both this spec and application code. Therefore, 
both values are stored as floating-point numbers. Conversion to 
and from these and an integer scale presented to the user in an 
application is easily accomplished in the application's code if 
it is so desired.

If a combination of rating tags exist when a file is being 
imported or read into a player's library, the user rating is 
considered canonical and takes precedence, meaning that if only a 
single value is being shown to the user it should be the 
user-defined value.

For all tag formats, the following is defined:

• A file that has no such tag is to be considered unrated for 
  that purpose (user or algorithm).

• If a user removes ratings from a track in the media player, the 
  user rating tag should be removed as well. The algorithmic 
  rating tag does not have to be removed in this instance.

• The identifier for the (canonical) user rating is “FMPS_Rating”
  . This should be set whenever a user rates the track, 
  regardless of whether they are also using user-specific ratings 
  as described below.

• If a player supports the notion of multiple users (perhaps from 
  discovery of the current user from the operating system) and 
  wishes to allow the users to keep separate ratings, the 
  identifier should be in the form “FMPS_Rating_User_Identifier” 
  where identifier is a user-defined value. Any spaces in the 
  username should be converted to = signs, e.g. “
  FMPS_Rating_User_Jeff=Mitchell”.

• The identifier for critic ratings is “FMPS_Rating_Critic_X” 
  where X names either a publication/site (“Rolling_Stone”, “
  Metacritic”) or a person in Firstname=Lastname format (“
  Ralph=Gleason”).

• The identifier for the algorithmic rating is “
  FMPS_Rating_Algorithm_X” where X names an arbitrary algorithm 
  name.

• Ratings are a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 
  is the lowest possible rating; 1.0 is the highest possible 
  rating.

• Ratings should only be rounded when necessary, in order to 
  increase cross-player compatibility.

A note on that last point: some players may only allow users to 
rate in increments of whole numbers between 1 and 5; others 0 and 
10; and so on. However, players should try to ensure that the 
rating they display and use for any purposes adheres to that 
saved in the tag when possible. For instance, if a track has a 
rating of 0.9 and an application only shows ratings using five 
star icons in full-star increments, this would be rounded within 
the application to five stars. However, the user may in fact have 
set the rating to 9/10 in another application. If the rating was 
being shown numerically, ideally the application would only round 
this number when absolutely necessary and display 4.5 instead of 
5, which would more accurately reflect the user's set rating.

1.3 Playcount Tags

As with ratings, there are both user and automatic playcount 
tags. The user tag is canonical and intended to be used in the 
normal sense, tracking how many times a song has been played (as 
defined below). The auto/algorithmic value can be used in an 
application-specific way to do interesting things; for instance, 
to cumulatively track exact percentages of tracks played, in 
order to display to the user the number of 
days/hous/minutes/seconds they have spent listening to a 
particular song. 

As with ratings, if both tags exist when a file is being imported 
or read into a player's library, the user playcount takes 
precedence for display.

For all tag formats, the following is defined:

• A file that has no such tag is to be considered unplayed for 
  that purpose (user or algorithm). Removing playcount 
  information from a track in the media player should cause the 
  user playcount tag to be removed as well. The algorithmic 
  playcount tag does not have to be removed in this instance.

• The identifier for the (canonical) user playcount is “
  FMPS_Playcount”. This should be incremented every time a user 
  plays the track, regardless of whether they are also using 
  user-specific playcounts as described below.

• If a player supports the notion of multiple users (perhaps from 
  discovery of the current user from the operating system) and 
  wishes to allow the users to keep separate playcounts, the 
  identifier should be in the form “FMPS_Playcount_User_X” where 
  X is a user-defined value. Any spaces in the username should be 
  converted to = signs, e.g. “FMPS_Playcount_User_Jeff=Mitchell”.

• The identifier for an algorithmic rating is “
  FMPS_Playcount_Algorithm_X” where X names an arbitrary 
  algorithm name.

• Playcounts are a float value with a minimum of 0.0, where 0.0 
  is an acceptable value but indicates that a track has not been 
  played (the same as if the track had no playcount tag). 
  Playcounts (especially the user playcount) can be shown to the 
  user as integers but must always be stored as a float.

• For the user playcount, playing a track (subject to the 
  criteria below) increases the user playcount value by 1.0. For 
  the algorithmic playcount, a track's length should be 
  considered to be worth 1.0; the user skipping parts of the 
  track may decrease the value below 1.0, and the user repeating 
  parts of the track may increase this value past 1.0.

• The maximum value is 0.000001 less than the largest value able 
  to be stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer: 
  4,294,967,294.999999. This is so that the float playcount value 
  can be rounded to an integer equivalent, if necessary.

The user playcount isn't meant to be set by the user, but rather 
to follow these rules that define user behavior. A file is to be 
considered “played” if it meets the following criteria, inspired 
by Last.fm's scrobbling rules:

• If the track is less than 30 seconds long, the entire song must 
  be played.

• If the track is more than 30 seconds long, at least fifty 
  percent of the file must be played, calculated via length of 
  track. For instance, if a track is one minute long, at least 
  thirty seconds of the track must have been played, although if 
  the user skips backwards multiple times and listens to the same 
  ten seconds of the track three times in a row, this may be 
  considered a valid playcount.

1.4 Performer Roles

Performer roles allow you to describe the performers in a track. 
Current support for these roles in tag formats is sporadic or 
difficult to parse. As many of these tags as desired can be 
specified, to include all relevant performer information.

For all tag formats, the following is defined:

• The identifier used is “FMPS_Performer:X”, where X is the 
  user-defined role (“Guitar”, “Guitar (Backup)”, “Vocals”).

• The value of each identifier is the role performer's name.

1.5 Lyrics

Embedding lyrics into a file allows users to save custom lyrics 
and to still see the lyrics when not connected to the Internet. 
Since different users may wish to have different sets of lyrics 
(for example, if customizing lyrics against a music-only track) 
and different Internet sources may have different lyrics, it is 
possible to store multiple lyrics values by specifying a source.

For all tag formats, the following is defined:

• The identifier for the (canonical) lyrics text is “FMPS_Lyrics”
  . The data must be a UTF-8 string of arbitrary length. Spaces, 
  tabs, and newlines should be preserved when saving the string 
  and displayed properly to the user.

• Lyrics identifiers may contain information as to the source: “
  FMPS_Lyrics_From_X” where X names either a publication/site (“
  Lyrics_Magazine”) or a person in Firstname=Lastname format (“
  Jeff=Mitchell”).
