    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
This specification gives direction on how to name the sounds that are
available for use by applications, when creating a sound theme. It
does so by laying out a standard naming scheme for sound creation, as
well as providing a minimal list of must have sounds, and a larger
list with many more examples to help with the creation of extended
sounds for third party applications, with different event types and
usage.

    <title>Sound Naming Guidelines</title>

    <para>
      Here we define some guidelines for when creating new sounds that
      extend the standardized list of sound names defined here, in
      order to provide sounds for more specific events and usages.
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Sound names are in the en_US.US_ASCII locale. This means
	    that the characters allowed in the sound names must
	    fall within the US-ASCII character set. As a further
	    restriction, all sound names may only contain lowercase
	    letters, numbers, underscore, dash, or period
	    characters. Spaces, colons, slashes, and backslashes are
	    not allowed. Also, sound names must be spelled as they are
	    in the en_US dictionary.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The dash <quote>-</quote> character is used to separate
	    levels of specificity in sound names.  For instance, we
	    use <quote>search-results</quote> as the generic item for
	    all search results, and we use
	    <quote>search-results-empty</quote> for an empty search
	    result. However, if the more specific item does not exist
	    in the current theme, and does exist in a parent theme,
	    the generic sound from the current theme is preferred, in
	    order to keep consistent style.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
	    Sounds for branded applications should be named the same
	    as the binary executable for the application, prefixed by
	    the string <quote>x-</quot>, to avoid name space clashes with future
	    standardized names. Example: <quote>x-openoffice-foobar</quote>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Please send suggestions for new standardized names to the XDG mailing list: <email>xdg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
