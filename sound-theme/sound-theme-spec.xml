    <para>
    A sound theme is a set of event sounds that share a common feel,
    or instrument set.  The user can then select the sound theme that
    they want to use, and all applications use sounds from the theme.
    </para>
    <para>
    From a programmer perspective a sound theme is just a
    mapping. Given a set of directories to look for sounds in and a
    theme name it maps from sound name to a sound filename.
    </para>

	  <para>
          A sound theme is a named set of sounds. It is used to map
          from a sound name. Themes may inherit
          from other themes as a way to extend them.

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Sound file</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
          The mandatory supported sound file formats are WAV/PCM
          8-48kHz, 8/16bits, and OGG/Vorbis. WAV at 48kHz/Stereo is
          the recommended uncompressed format, and OGG/Vorbis is the
          recommended compressed format.  The sample must be
          normalized, in order to be mixed down nicely with a suitable
          average replay level.

	<term>Base Directory</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
          Sounds and themes are searched for in a set of directories,
          called base directories. The themes are stored in
          subdirectories of the base directories.
	  </para>

      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="directory_layout">
    <title>Directory Layout</title>
    <para>
    Sounds and themes are looked for in a set of directories. By
    default, applications should look in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/sounds.  Applications
    may further add their own sound directories to this list, and
    users may extend or change the list (in application/desktop
    specific ways). In each of these directories themes are stored as
    subdirectories. A theme can be spread across several base
    directories by having subdirectories of the same name. This way
    users can extend and override system themes.
    </para>
    <para>
    In order to have a place for third party applications to install
    their sounds there should always exist a theme called
    "freedesktop". The data for the freedesktop theme is available for
    download at: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/sound-theme/.
    Implementations are required to look in the "freedesktop" theme if
    a sound was not found in the current theme.
    </para>
    <para>
    Each theme is stored as subdirectories of the base
    directories. The internal name of the theme is the name of the
    subdirectory, although the user-visible name as specified by the
    theme may be different. Hence, theme names are case sensitive, and
    are limited to ASCII characters. Theme names may also not contain
    comma or space.
    </para>
    <para>
    In at least one of the theme directories there must be a file
    called index.theme that describes the theme. The first index.theme
    found while searching the base directories in order is used. This
    file describes the general attributes of the theme.
    </para>
    <para>
    In the theme directory are also a set of subdirectories containing
    sound files. The subdirectories are allowed to be several levels
    deep, e.g. the subdirectory "stereo/alerts" in the theme "freedesktop"
    would end up at $basedir/freedesktop/stereo/alerts.
    </para>
    <para>
    The sounds files must be one of the types: WAV/PCM 8-48kHz, 8/16
    bits or OGG/Vorbis.  The extension must be ".wav", or ".ogg"
    respectively (lower case).In addition to the sound files there may
    be an additional file with extra sound data for each file. It
    should have the same basename as the sound file, with the
    extension ".sound". e.g. if the sound file is called
    "system-shutdown.wav" the corresponding file would be named
    "system-shutdown.sound".
    </para>
    <para>
    The sound samples must be normalized with a suitable average
    replay level, in order to be properly mixed down. For more
    informations, please read
    http://replaygain.hydrogenaudio.org/calculationg_rg.html and
    check that your volume level is reasonable.
    </para>
    <para>
    Sounds for different output profiles (i.e. for Stereo, Surround
    4.1, Surround 5.1 and so on) may be part of a theme. All
    implementations are required to fallback to the "stereo" output
    profile as last resort.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="file_formats">
    <title>File Formats</title>
    <para>
    Both the sound theme description file and the sound data files are
    ini-style text files, as described in the desktop file
    specification. They don't have an encoding field. Instead, they
    must always be stored in UTF-8 encoding.
    </para>
    <para>
    The index.theme file must start with a section called
    <citetitle>Sound Theme</citetitle>, with contents according to
    table 1 below. All lists are comma-separated.

  <sect1 id="sound_lookup">
    <title>Sound Lookup</title>
    <para>
    The sound lookup mechanism has two global settings, the list of
    base directories and the internal name of the current theme. Given
    these we specify how to look up sound file from the sound
    name.
    </para>
    <para>
    The lookup is done first in the current theme, and then
    recursively in each of the current theme's parents, and finally in
    the default theme called "freedesktop" (implementations may add
    more default themes before "freedesktop", but "freedesktop" must
    be last). A last fallback is unthemed sound. As soon as there is
    a sound that matches in a theme, the search is stopped.
    </para>
    <para>
    To support localized sounds we first lookup the sound in the
    LC_MESSAGES locale setting of the program. If that fails, the
    locale string is truncated at the "@" if it includes it and it is
    tried again. Then, the locale string is truncated at the "_" if it
    includes it and it is tried again. Then it is looked for a sound
    in the "C" locale. Finally non-localized sound files are searched.
    </para>
    <para>
    If a sound name is not found, it is truncated at the last "-" and
    it is tried again. This is done again until no further "-" are
    present in the name string. This is useful to define common sounds
    for similar events. i.e. instead of defining two seperate sounds
    for "new-message-im" and "new-message-email" it might make sense
    to define just "new-message" instead.
    </para>
    <para>
    The lookup is done first in the requested output profile, followed
    by a lookup in "stereo" on failure and then without any output
    profile.
    </para>
    <para>
    The exact algorithm (in pseudocode) for looking up a sound in a
    theme is:

    <programlisting>
FindSound(sound, locale, outputprofile, theme) {
  filename = LookupSound (sound, locale, outputprofile, theme)
  if filename != none
    return filename

  if theme has parents
    for parent in theme.parents {
      filename = LookupSound (sound, locale, outputprofile, parent)
      if filename != none
        return filename
    }

  return none
}
     </programlisting>

     With the following helper functions:

     <programlisting>
LookupSound (requestedname, requestedlocale, requestedoutputprofile, requestedtheme) {
  for theme in (requestedtheme,
                "freedesktop",
                "") {
    for each locale in (requestedlocale,
                        truncatesuffix(requestedlocale, "@"),
                        truncatesuffix(requestedlocale, "_"),
                        "C",
                        "") {
      for each name in (requestedname,
                        truncatesuffix(requestedname, "-"),
                        truncatesuffix(truncatesuffix(requestedname, "-"), "-"),
                        truncatesuffix(truncatesuffix(truncatesuffix(requestedname, "-"), "-"), "-"),
                        ...) {
        for profile in (requestedoutputprofile, "stereo", "") {
          for each subdir in $(theme subdir list) {
            if DirectoryMatchesOutputProfile(subdir, profile) {
              for each directory in $(basename list) {
                for extension in ("wav", "ogg") {
	          filename = directory/theme/subdir/locale/name.extension
                  if exist filename
                    return filename
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return none
}

DirectoryMatchesOutputProfile(subdir, profile) {
  read OutputProfile from subdir
  if OutputProfile == profile
    return true
  return false
}
</programlisting>

    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="example">
    <title>Example</title>
    <para>
     Here is an example index.theme file:
     <programlisting>
[Sound Theme]
Name=Birch
Name[fr]=Bouleau
Comment=Sound theme using wooden instruments
Comment[fr]=Theme utilisant des instruments en bois
Inherits=wood,default
Directories=stereo/alert/fr notifications/long/5.1

[stereo/alert/fr]
Context=Alert
OutputProfile=stereo

[notifications/long/5.1]
Context=Notification
OutputProfile=5.1
</programlisting>

The corresponding directory tree in the /usr/share/sounds
directory could look like this:

<programlisting>
birch/index.theme
birch/stereo/alert/evolution-urgent-message.ogg
birch/stereo/alert/evolution-urgent-message.wav
birch/stereo/alert/fr/evolution-urgent-message.ogg
birch/stereo/alert/evolution-urgent-message.sound
birch/5.1/alert/evolution-urgent-message.ogg
</programlisting>

Where birch/stereo/alert/evolution-urgent-message.sound contains:

<programlisting>
[Sound Data]
DisplayName=Evolution urgent message
DisplayName[fr]=Message urgent dans Evolution
Loop=yes
</programlisting>

    </para>
    <para>
    In this example a lookup of "evolution-urgent-message", with a 5.1

    "birch/5.1/alert/evolution-urgent-message.ogg" sound file.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="install_sounds">
    <title>Installing Application Sounds</title>
    <para>
    If you're an application author and you want to install sounds
    so that they can be used by your application, you should
    at least install the sound file in the "freedesktop" theme. This means
    installing a stereo WAV file in
    $XDG_DATA_DIRS/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/$context.
    </para>
    <para>
    Optionally you can install sounds in different formats and
    languages. For example, installing a localized OGG/Vorbis 5.1 game
    sound in $prefix/share/sounds/freedesktop/5.1/game/fr.
    </para>
    <para>
    You might even want to install sounds that match other well
    known themes so your application will fit in with some specific
    desktop environment.
    </para>
    <para>
    It is recommended that the sounds installed in the freedesktop
    theme sound neutral, since it is a fallback theme that will be
    used in combination with some very different sounds from any
    origin. But if you don't have any neutral sound, please install
    whatever sound you have in the freedesktop theme so that all your
    application can at least produce some sounds in all themes.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="implementation_notes">
    <title>Implementation Notes</title>
    <para>
    The algorithm as described in this document works by always
    looking up filenames in directories (a stat in unix
    terminology). A good implementation is expected to read the
    directories once, and do all lookups in memory using that
    information.
    </para>
    <para>
    This caching can make it impossible for users to add sounds without
    having to restart applications. In order to handle this, any
    implementation that does caching is required to look at the mtime
    of the toplevel sound directories when doing a cache lookup, unless
    it already did so less than 5 seconds ago. This means that any
    sound editor or theme installation program need only to change the
    mtime of the the toplevel directory where it changed the theme to
    make sure that the new sounds will eventually get used.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="background">
