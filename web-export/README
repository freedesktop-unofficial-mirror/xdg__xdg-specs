This directory contains the files used to export the specifications on
  http://specifications.freedesktop.org/

It's mostly two files:

 - specs.idx: information on where to fetch specific versions of different
   specifications (usually from git)

 - update.py: hacky script that uses specs.idx and creates html pages
