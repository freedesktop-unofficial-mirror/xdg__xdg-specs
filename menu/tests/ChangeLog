	* tests/2/result,
	  tests/2/test: test the new <OnlyUnallocated> behaviour.

2004-08-29  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* tests/m: test for NoDisplay=true behavious in .desktop and
	.directory files.
	
	* data/hidden.desktop,
	  data/hidden.directory: add.
	
	* data/apps.directory: add Type=Directory.
	
	* menutest: actually generate a test result if one doesn't
	exist - makes it easier to write new tests.
