This directory contains regression tests for the menu-spec.

To run these tests your menu-spec implementation should be 
able to generate a menu in the following text format:

<Full Menu Name><tab><Desktop File Id><tab><Full Path to Desktop File>

Example:

Editors/    kde-kwrite.desktop      /home/bastian/.local/share/applications/kde-kwrite.desktop
Editors/    kde-kate.desktop        /home/bastian/.local/share/applications/kde-kate.desktop
Editors/    kde-KEdit.desktop       /home/bastian/.local/share/applications/kde-KEdit.desktop
Development/    kde-gideon.desktop      /opt/kde3/share/applnk/Development/gideon.desktop
Development/    kde-kbabel.desktop      /opt/kde3/share/applnk/Development/kbabel.desktop
Development/    kde-quanta.desktop      /opt/kde3/share/applnk/Development/quanta.desktop
/       kde-Kfind.desktop       /opt/kde3/share/applnk/Kfind.desktop
/       kde-Home.desktop        /opt/kde3/share/applnk/Home.desktop
/       kde-Help.desktop        /opt/kde3/share/applnk/Help.desktop



The environment variable $MENUTEST should point to a command that is
able to generate the menu in the above format.

The menutest script should be used to run the tests. The following commands can
be used:

	MENUTEST=foobar menutest

to run all tests

	MENUTEST=foobar menutest test-1

to run test-1 only


All tests contain of a test setup script that starts with "test-" and a file describing
the expected menu that starts with "result-".
